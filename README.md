# This is a PhP Client for Xenmobile (version >10.3) REST Webservice

Aim : Provide a PhP client for Citrix Xenmobile Rest Webservices (for version superior or equal to 10.3)
Means : php, composer, pear, phpDocumentor, github, community I hope :)
Constraints :
  - handle versions "release" to match with Citrix's Xenmobile REST Webservices upon needs or request : provider webservices responses can be disturbing (with a status containing a message without a status..), so singularity have been added to classes in order to handle that.
